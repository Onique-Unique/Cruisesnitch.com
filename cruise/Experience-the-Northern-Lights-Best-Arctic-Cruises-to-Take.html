                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Late August and Early September: The start of aurora season is generally late August or early September. During this time of year, you are likely to see the smaller, dimmer version of the Northern Lights due to cooler temperatures in the area.</li>
                            <li class="text">Late September and Mid-October: This is peak season for the Northern Lights, as the sun is at its lowest point in the sky and temperatures are ideal for a display of the colorful night sky.</li>
                            <li class="text">Mid-December to Late February: The sun is still relatively low in the sky during late December to late February, which makes northern lights sighting easier.</li>
                            <li class="text">Early March to Late April: This is a great time of year to get a glimpse of the Northern Lights as the sky is clear and temperatures are mild.</li>

                            <li class="text">Thermal base layers: You're going to need to layer up to stay warm and comfortable while onboard, no matter what the weather throws your way. Opt for breathable yet insulated fabrics like wool, fleece and polyester.</li>
                            <li class="text">Thick quality socks: Invest in a few pairs of thick inner socks and heavier outer socks to keep your feet warm, dry and blister-free.</li>

                            <li class="text">Cross-trainers: Wear dedicated fitness shoes for exercising onboard and for exploring off-ship. The grip will help you stay safe in icy conditions.</li>
                            <li class="text">Portable thermal blankets: Tuck a few thermal blankets in your bag to keep warm during shore hikes and activities.</li>
                            <li class="text">Hat, scarf, and gloves: Don't forget these essential cold-weather accessories for added warmth and comfort on deck.</li>
                            <li class="text">Survival kit: Pack a mini survival kit with multi-purpose items like a pocket knife, fire starter, a compass and a first-aid kit to help keep you safe in the event of an emergency.</li>
