                        <p class="text" id="share-description">Planning your next cruise can be an exciting and fun experience, but it's important to be aware of potential issues that can arise, especially for pier runners. Pier runners are passengers who arrive at the port late and risk being left behind by their ship.</p>
                        <p class="text">To avoid this stressful situation, there are several factors to consider before your next cruise in 2023, including the time of year, transportation arrangements, and travel insurance coverage.</p>
