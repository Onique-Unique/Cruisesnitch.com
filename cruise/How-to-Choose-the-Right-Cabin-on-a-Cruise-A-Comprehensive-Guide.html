                            <li class="text">Location: Consider the cruise route and where your ideal cabin location is located on board.</li>
                            <li class="text">Price: Compare the onboard amenities against the cost of suites to decide how much money you are willing to spend.</li>
                            <li class="text">Size: Depending on the number of people in your party, you'll need to choose a cabin that can accommodate everyone comfortably.</li>
                            <li class="text">View: Do you prefer a scenic view of the ocean or the vibrant city lights? Choose a cabin that offers the kind of view that appeals to you.</li>

                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Invest in vacuum bags: By storing clothes and other items in vacuum bags, you can maximize the space in your cabin by reducing the bulky size of the items.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize the walls: Use wall-mounted racks and hooks to hang items such as beach bags and hats, freeing up floor space.</li>
                            <li class="text">Make use of the luggage racks: Donâ€™t let the space above them go to waste; stack items such as suitcases on them to create more available storage.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize under-the-bed storage: Consider using storage boxes or bins to store items such as clothing and shoes, freeing up more space.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pack only the essentials: Before packing, make a list of the items you need, and then pack only the must-haves. This will ensure you have the least amount of items with you.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize space saving tools: Utilize items like over the door hanging pockets, stackable plastic drawers, and corner shelves to make the most of any unused space.</li>
                            <li class="text">Stack items vertically: Utilize vertical space whenever possible by stacking items on top of each other, such as suitcases, rather than leaving them laying flat.</li>
                            <li class="text">Don't overlook the bathroom: Hang towel racks and shelves in the bathroom to store items such as toiletries, lotions, and shampoos.</li>
