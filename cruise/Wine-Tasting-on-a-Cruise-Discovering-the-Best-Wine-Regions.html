                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Research local wines: before embarking on your cruise. Knowing what youâ€™ll find onboard and where it comes from can help you anticipate what to expect and plan your tastings accordingly.</li>
                            <li class="text">Choose an experienced wine connoisseur: to accompany you. Having an expert along to guide your tastings and answer any questions you may have can be a great way to get the most out of your experience.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
