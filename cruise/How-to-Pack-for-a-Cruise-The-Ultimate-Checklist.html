                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-2">What are some essential items to pack for a cruise that many people often forget?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Before you set sail on your cruise, it's important to make sure you don't forget any essential items!</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some items you may overlook, but will be essential for enjoying your cruise:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Reusable Water Bottle: When on a cruise, it's easy to forget how much you're drinking, so having a reusable water bottle on hand can be essential. Not only is it better for the environment, but it will also ensure that you stay hydrated throughout your trip.</li>
                            <li class="text">Sunscreen: Since you'll likely be spending a lot of time out in the sun, having a good, high-SPF sunscreen is essential for protecting your skin and avoiding sunburns.</li>
                            <li class="text">Electrical Adapter: If you're going to be using electronics while at sea, make sure they are compatible with the ship's plug sockets. Many ships use other electrical systems, so having an adapter is essential.</li>
                            <li class="text">Motion Sickness Pills: If you're prone to motion sickness, make sure to have motion sickness pills on hand to help alleviate your symptoms. In some cases these pills can be provided onboard, but you'd like to have it before having to need it.</li>
                            <li class="text">Cash: While most ships are cashless, there may be certain vendors or activities that require cash. Small denominations are generally accepted, so make sure to bring enough for any unforeseen purchases.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">By following this essential packing list, you can rest assured that you won't forget anything important on your cruise!</p>

                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Categorize You Belongings: Start by organizing your items into different categories (clothes, electronics, toiletries, etc). This will help you figure out what items you actually need to bring and will prevent you from overpacking.</li>
                            <li class="text">Roll Your Clothes: Rolling your clothes instead of folding them is a great way to save space in your suitcase. This will help you fit more items into a small space.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize Every Space: Use every space in your bag when packing. Stuff shoes and clothes into corners, roll your socks and put them inside your shoes, and even carrying around a small bag for jewelry, documents, phone chargers, and so on.</li>
                            <li class="text">Minimize Your Footwear: Try and limit the number of pairs of shoes you bring. Stick to a pair of shoes and sandals if necessary.</li>
                            <li class="text">Use Travel-Sized Products: Replace your full-sized products with their travel-sized counterparts. This will help save you space and weight in your luggage.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize Accessories: Use packing accessories such as packing cubes, compression bags, or vacuum-sealed bags to help you save more space and avoid overpacking.</li>

                            <li class="text">Pack for a range of temperatures: Layering is key so you're equipped for anything from chilly mornings to scorching afternoons. Pack clothing for warm and cold climates as well as rain attire.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pack a variety of shoes: Closed toed shoes are typically recommended when participating in shore activities, but sandals are great for relaxing on the deck or walking on the beach.</li>
                            <li class="text">Accessorize with hats and sunglasses: Sun-protection is very important in tropical climates, so make sure to pack a hat and sunglasses to protect your head and eyes.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring along some multipurpose items: A sarong can be used as a scarf, a towel, or even a shawl. A scarf can be used as a top layer or a swimsuit cover-up.</li>
                            <li class="text">Prep for different destinations: Make sure you have all the necessary items for shore excursions, such as sunscreen and a bug repellent. Check the official website for information on local customs and laws.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pack an extra bag for souvenirs: You'll be able to pack more clothing and items in this bag, so you won't have to worry about running out of space in your luggage when you collect souvenirs from the different destinations.</li>
