                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-2">What are the must-see sights and activities during an Alaskan cruise?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Cruising to Alaska is certainly an unforgettable experience and there are a plethora of amazing sights and activities you won't want to miss! </p>
                    <p class="text">Here's my top five recommendations:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve: This is one of Alaskaâ€™s most beautiful regions and it's teeming with wildlife. Take in gorgeous blue glaciers and witness the antics of the humpback and orca whales as they frolic in the cold, clear waters.</li>
                            <li class="text">Kachemak Bay: One of Alaska's most pristine bays, Kachemak is a fantastic destination for scenic kayaking. Explore seals and porpoises swimming about and then try your hand at some of the excellent fishing opportunities available!</li>
                            <li class="text">Whale Watching & Wildlife Viewing: Keep an eye out for beluga, minke, and humpback whales during your cruise, as well as other majestic creatures like bald eagles and mountain goats.</li>
                            <li class="text">Denali National Park: Spot grizzly bears and other wildlife while trekking through the park. Take some time to admire the beauty of Mt. McKinley, the tallest mountain in North America.</li>
                            <li class="text">Dog Sledding: Experience a real Alaskan adventure by taking a real dog sled tour along some of the trails in the region. Get up close and personal with wolves, foxes, and other wildlife as you take in the stunning scenery.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br><br>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-3">How can you prepare for the climate and weather conditions in Alaska during your cruise?</h2>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Bring the right clothing: Layering will be key - the temperature can change drastically throughout the course of a day. Bring waterproof and insulated items, like a snow jacket, insulated pants, and wool or synthetic base layers.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring a Camera: The spectacular weather conditions and amazing views will be ideal for capturing unforgettable photos. Make sure to have several memory cards and extra batteries.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring your sunglasses: The Sun reflects off the snow, which magnifies the glare, so make sure to have good quality sunglasses that protect from UV radiation.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pack sunscreen: Even though the temperatures may be cold, you can still get sunburn if the sun is very intense and you don't use a sunscreen.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring a hat with a brim: Keeping your head and face warm is key to staying comfortable during the cruise, and a good hat with a brim will help prevent windburn.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check the weather forecast: Before you start your cruise, check the weather forecast so you can plan accordingly - you will want to dress in layers and carry appropriate items with you.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring warm, waterproof shoes: Sturdy, waterproof shoes with good traction will help you stay safe and comfortable during the cruise. Good quality boots are essential; they will keep your feet warm and dry while providing good support.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring a personal umbrella: Despiting the unpredictable weather in Alaska, it's not a bad idea to bring along a compact personal umbrella, just in case.</li>
                        </ul>
