                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Start planning your cruise early: Booking your trip in advance can give you access to the best deals and discounts, so start the planning process anywhere from six months to one year in advance.</li>
                            <li class="text">Sign up for cruise line newsletters: Cruise lines regularly send out special offers and discounts on their newsletter subscription lists.</li>
                            <li class="text">Shop around: Compare rates online and check with different travel agencies and cruise lines to see who is offering the best deals.</li>
                            <li class="text">Look for last-minute deals: Cruise lines tend to offer deals to fill their vessels at the last minute. Waiting until the last minute can save you hundreds of dollars.</li>
                            <li class="text">Book during shoulder season: Cruises during shoulder season (fall, late spring, early winter or late summer) tend to be cheaper than cruises during peak season.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize the power of bidding websites: Use websites such as VacationstoGo.com or CruiseCompete.com, who offer cruise auctions and deals from several different cruise lines.</li>
                            <li class="text">Consider package deals: Keep an eye out for discount packages that include flight, hotel, and cruise. These package deals can sometimes be more affordable than buying everything individually.</li>
                            <li class="text">Book during certain holiday seasons: Booking cruises during major holidays such as New Yearâ€™s, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and Christmas can often result in better rates.</li>
                            <li class="text">Wander from the itinerary: If the exact date or exact type of cruise itinerary is not essential to you, you may be able to snag a lower price.</li>
                            <li class="text">Choose a cabin wisely: The cabin you choose can significantly affect your rate and overall experience. Carefully weigh the amenities you desire in a cabin against what is actually included in your price.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Determine a budget: for your cruise cabin. Consider not just the cost of the cabin, but potential associated costs such as taxes, gratuities, and specific amenities.</li>
                            <li class="text">Compare prices: between different cabin categories to ensure you are getting the best value for your money.</li>
                            <li class="text">Consider location of the cabin: Depending on the ship, cabins located closer to the center of the ship tend to experience less movement than those located on either side of the ship.</li>
                            <li class="text">Assess cabin size and features: Compare the number of people who can inhabit the cabin, the available amenities, and square footage of the cabin.</li>
                            <li class="text">Examine the balcony space options: Cabins with balconies may be slightly more expensive, but offer more room and a better view.</li>
                            <li class="text">Consider the benefits: of being higher up on the ship. Higher cabins provide more breathtaking views, but may create more motion sickness.</li>
                            <li class="text">Be aware: of noise levels from outside sources such as restaurants, bars, libraries, or theaters.</li>
                            <li class="text">Research existing reviews: on the cabin and its location to get a better idea of your experience.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize online resources: such as Cruise Critic to get detailed descriptions of the cabin and its attributes.</li>
                            <li class="text">Only purchase: a cabin if you are comfortable with the price, amenities, and ambiance.</li>
