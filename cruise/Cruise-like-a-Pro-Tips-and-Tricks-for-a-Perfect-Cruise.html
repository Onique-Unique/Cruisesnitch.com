                            <li class="text">Rely on the Locals: Before departing on your cruise in 2023, research the port of calls to have a better sense of the culture and amenities offered. Utilize tour operators based in the port who can give you insider tips on all the best activities you wonâ€™t find advertised.</li>
                            <li class="text">Get Social: Donâ€™t be afraid to get to know the locals and other passengers on board. Joining group activities, attending lectures, and participating in conversation is a great way to learn about the culture, cuisine, and lifestyle of your destination.</li>
                            <li class="text">Plan Ahead: With the rise of mobile booking, itâ€™s easier than ever to select your ideal cruise experience on the go. Plan ahead to pick up deals and make sure you get the most of your trip. Consider booking shore excursions, dining reservations for specialty restaurants, and onboard activities in advance.</li>
                            <li class="text">Be Flexible: Bears and storms can sometimes throw off your game plan. Cruise lines often need to adjust routes to avoid bad weather and may make stops at different ports. Keep an open mind when it comes to destinationsâ€”you may end up discovering something even better than you had planned.</li>
                            <li class="text">Packing 101: Before you go, make a list of what youâ€™ll need and use a rolling bag or carry-on when packing. Also consider holding off on purchasing souvenirs until disembarkation day as excess baggage may incur charges.</li>
                            <li class="text">Embrace the Moment: One of the best ways to have a perfect cruise in 2023 is to take advantage of the down time to enjoy your surroundings. Lay out on the deck, take a dip in the pool, or attend the evening entertainment. Take the time to enjoy the unique experiences that come from cruising.</li>
