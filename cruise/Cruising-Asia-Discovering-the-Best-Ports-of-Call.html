                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Respect is extremely important in Asia: while itâ€™s ok to ask questions and make conversation, always be careful to remain polite and humble. Showing respect to elders and those in positions of authority is essential.</li>
                            <li class="text">Gift giving is common in Asia: so keep small items such as candy, flowers, or tea on hand! Itâ€™s also important to ensure the gift is appropriate for the receiver â€“ for example, never give a red item to someone at a funeral, as it is a sign of bad luck.</li>
