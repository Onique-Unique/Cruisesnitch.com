                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-4">What are some common safety myths about cruising that you should be aware of and how can you separate fact from fiction?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Often, there are a lot of conflicting or exaggerated opinions on whatâ€™s safe and whatâ€™s not when it comes to cruising.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some common safety myths about cruising that you should be aware of:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Myth 1: There's a High Risk of Crime <br><br>The Reality - Contrary to popular opinion, crime isnâ€™t very common on cruise ships. According to the Cruise Lines International Association, the chance of experiencing theft or any other crime on a cruise is 1 in 1.9 million passengers.</li>
                            <li class="text">Myth 2: It's Hard to Stay Healthy on a Cruise <br><br> The Reality - Many ships offer a wide range of activities and amenities such as spa services and healthy dining options that can make it easier than ever to stay fit and healthy, even while on vacation.</li>
                            <li class="text">Myth 3: Cruises Are Very Expensive <br><br> The Reality - While cruise packages vary in price, vacationers with limited budgets can often find deals on smaller vessels and cruises that limited their number of ports of call.</li>

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">The best way to separate fact from fiction is to read reviews of cruise lines and research any potential concerns with the booking agency.</p>
