                            <li class="text">Buy souvenirs: Stocking up on local specialities and trinkets not only gives you a memento of your trip but also helps local businesses, who will appreciate the custom.</li>
                            <li class="text">Network: Squeeze in a bit of networking by meeting locals or other travellers on board the ship or during a port call.</li>
                            <li class="text">Have fun: Finally, if you can afford it, why not indulge a bit and treat yourself to something special? That could be anything from high tea in a castle or a spa treatment during your port call. Enjoy!</li>
