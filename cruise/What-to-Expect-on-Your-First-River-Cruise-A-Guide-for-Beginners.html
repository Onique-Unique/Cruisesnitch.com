                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Choose an excursion: that is tailored to your personal interests - Seek out shore excursions that align with what you love doing. Whether it be cultural activities, nature trips, history lessons, or food tours, look for excursions that are tailored to not just your cruise port, but also to you.</li>
                            <li class="text">Make the most of each excursion: by planning ahead - Prior to your disembarkation for the day, research what youâ€™d like to do and see, and plan accordingly. Bring along a map and a digital camera if you have one, and donâ€™t be shy about asking locals for tips or advice.</li>
                            <li class="text">Take advantage of any onboard services: Most river cruise ships provide free shuttles to and from ports, and also offer onboard activities such as cooking demonstrations and beer tastings. Take advantage of extra on-ship activities so that you donâ€™t miss out on any extra fun while ashore.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring along cash & book ahead: Make sure you bring some cash with you just in case there are any items you may want to purchase during your excursion, and be sure to book any shore excursions ahead of time to avoid disappointment.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pace yourself: Donning all of the sights of the day can be tiring, so be sure to pace yourself and to take time to relax and recharge once in a while. Donâ€™t be afraid to skip something if you know youâ€™ll be too exhausted.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pack for all conditions: The weather can sometimes be unpredictable, so make sure to pack for all sorts of conditions. From heavy rain jackets to lightweight t-shirts and even lightweight umbrellas, it pays to be prepared for any situation.</li>
                            <li class="text">Take plenty of photos: Last but not least, be sure to bring a digital camera or a smartphone in order to capture all of your amazing memories. Just remember to be in the moment, too.</li>
