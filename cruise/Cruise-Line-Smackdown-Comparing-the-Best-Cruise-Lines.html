                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-4">What are the most important factors to consider when choosing a cabin on a cruise ship?</h2>
                    <p class="text">When selecting a cabin for your cruise, there are several things to consider to make sure you find the perfect space for your needs.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Firstly: consider the size of the cabin. Try to picture the layout of the room to see if it is suitable for the number of passengers that you will be sharing the cabin with. Factors such as the location, noise level, and your budget also need to be taken into account when deciding which cabin is right for you.</li>
                            <li class="text">You will want to think: about the view from your cabin, as many cabins offer stunning views of the open ocean. If you prefer some privacy, consider choosing an interior cabin or a cabin on a lower deck. For a more roomy and spacious experience, aim to book an aft-facing or suite cabin.</li>
                            <li class="text">Cruise ships also offer: different levels of cabin amenities and services. When looking for cabin amenities, think about if you will need things like air conditioning, a mini fridge, a television, a hairdryer, and storage space.</li>
                            <li class="text">Finally: it's important to research the cruise line's policies and cancellation fees to ensure you are fully prepared for any potential scenarios that may arise.</li>
