                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text"> Set a budget: Decide how much you are willing to pay per person on a cruise before starting your search. This'll help you narrow down your options and ensure that you don't overspend.</li>
                            <li class="text">Shop around: Contact a few different cruise lines for their discounts and promotions, and compare prices to find the best deals.</li>
                            <li class="text">Book early: Generally, the earlier you book a cruise, the more affordable it tends to be, so consider booking your cruise as far in advance as possible.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check family or loyalty benefits: See if any family or loyalty benefits you may have can be applied to your travel to secure a good deal.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize cruise search engines: Online cruise search engines are fantastic resources for discovering affordable cruise deals. Use them to search for the right cruise for you at the best price.</li>
                            <li class="text">Consider repositioning cruises: Repositioning cruises can be an excellent option for those looking for a great deal. They are usually discounted as the cruise line needs to reposition the ship from one port to another.</li>
                            <li class="text">Join cruise-specific newsletters: Sign up for cruise-specific newsletters or email lists to keep up to date on promotions as they come up. Some cruise lines may even offer exclusive discounts to newsletter subscribers.</li>
                            <li class="text">Consider buy-one-get-one deals: Keep an eye out for "buy-one-get-one" deals, where you can purchase one cruise ticket and receive a second one for free.</li>
                            <li class="text">Explore last-minute deals: With cruise lines needing to fill their remaining berths, they may offer steep discounts during the last minute. If you don't mind the uncertainty, this can be a great way to score some amazing deals.</li>

                            <li class="text">Bring your own beverages on board: Yes you've read that right - Many cruise ships allow passengers to bring a limited amount of beer or wine with them especially when out at port. This will save you money on drinks throughout the cruise.</li>
                            <li class="text">Purchase all-inclusive packages: Most cruise lines offer discounted packages that include meals and activities. Make sure to compare packages and find the one that fits your needs and budget.</li>

                            <li class="text">Take advantage of the on-board credit: Many cruise lines offer on-board credit for excursions, meals, and drinks. Make sure to take advantage of this to save money on the expenses.</li>
                            <li class="text">Purchase a beverage card: If you plan to drink often and need to stay within a budget, consider a beverage package which allows you to pay for drinks upfront at a discounted rate.</li>
