                            <li class="text">Prioritize what matters most: Whether your main focus is a particular destination, activities at each port, onboard entertainment, or fine-dining, make a list of what you most want out of a river cruise and sort it in order of priority.</li>
                            <li class="text">Read reviews: Cruise directors, fellow travelers, and travel websites can provide valuable insight into different cruise lines and their experiences. Find out which cruises and cruise ships get the highest ratings, which offer the best amenities, and which have the most satisfied customers.</li>
                            <li class="text">Research the routes and ports of call: A river cruise in 2023 will most likely follow a set route with set ports of call. Make sure the route that interests you will be operating in 2023 and ensure each port provides activities and attractions that appeal to you.</li>
                            <li class="text">Consider price and onboard extras: Many cruise lines offer â€˜extrasâ€™ such as free drinks packages, onboard credit, or reduced deposits. Compare prices, amenities and schedule to get the most value for your money.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check for discounts and promotions: Take advantage of discounts for early bookings or certain seasons. Look out for special promotions, such as off-peak discounts or deals for returning customers, to save even more.</li>
                            <li class="text">Compare itineraries: A river cruise involves a lot of sailing time, so itâ€™s worth comparing itineraries to choose one with plenty of open time for exploration or relaxation. Also double-check the duration of transfers and day trips as some may last longer than others.</li>
                            <li class="text">Choose the right cruise line: Every cruise line offers different facilities, onboard entertainment and customer service. Look carefully at what each cruise line has to offer and decide which is best for you.</li>
                            <li class="text">Select your cabin type: Cabin types vary from cruise line to cruise line, from rooms with balconies, to suites with panoramic windows. Factor in the comfort, size and amenities to choose the one most suited to your needs.</li>
                            <li class="text">Review the lifestyle onboard: Depending on the cruise line, onboard lifestyle can be quite regulated or more relaxed, so choose a cruise line that fits in with how you want to spend your vacation.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check included extras: Many cruises include some meals, drinks, and excursions as standard, so make sure these perks fit with your cruise desires before you book.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Intimacy: River cruises offer a more intimate, small-scale experience than other forms of travel. With a limited number of passengers, you'll feel like you're getting a personalized experience as you explore ports and areas while onboard.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ease of Access: River cruises offer easy and comfortable access to off-the-beaten-path towns and areas. No need to deal with stressful transportation or find accommodations in a foreign land. You can settle into your room and explore each destination from the comfort of your cruise ship.</li>
                            <li class="text">Lower Cost: River cruising tends to be more budget-friendly than other types of travel. You can enjoy premium accommodations, meals, and drinks for one low daily rate. Plus, with fewer tourists, there's less competition for attractions and sights, which can help you save money.</li>
                            <li class="text">Scenic Views: Several river cruise ships offer large balconies for stunning views of the passing landscape. From quaint villages to snow-capped mountains, you'll get to witness breathtaking scenery you would have never seen if you were on a traditional cruise.</li>
                            <li class="text">Non-stop Amenities: River cruises are perfect for those looking for a relaxing getaway. Whether you want to be pampered in the spa or take in a movie, river cruises offer nearly non-stop amenities and activities you won't find on other cruises.</li>
                            <li class="text">Reduced Carbon Footprint: River cruises place less impact on the environment than traditional cruises or plane travel. Since the ships are smaller and consume less fuel, the entire trip has a smaller carbon footprint.</li>
